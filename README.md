My generic reply to headhunters:

```
Dear Headhunter,

thank you for your message and the interest in my person. 

Unfortunately, I’m very happy with my current job. My working 
environment demands permanently for both, my mathematical 
expertise and my various programming skills. Not only do I have 
the privilege to collaborate with highly academic people on 
challenging problems within extremely diverse project backgrounds, 
but I also learn new things and educate myself every day!

Currently, I don’t see any reason why I should change anything on 
my situation (although earning money is by far not the main criteria 
for my personal empoyment-selection-process, be rest assured that I 
get a decent amount of such). I promise you that once any of the 
conditions stated above changes, you are one of the first I will 
get in touch with.

So long, stay tuned!
<your name>
